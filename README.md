I’m building the future of intelligent automation.

With 8+ years of experience in software engineering, QA automation, and Python development, I now focus on designing intelligent agents and AI-powered systems that can reason, plan, and execute complex workflows — just like a human would.

I don’t just talk about AI. I build it. Below are some of my live AI MVPs. You can try them now:

🚀 My Live AI MVPs

🧠 BestAI – AI Evaluation Framework

🏠 VisionFlow AI – AI Onboarding Agent for Utility Companies

📄 AI RFP Assistant – Proposal Drafting Agent
📌 Resume Screener AI – Smart Candidate Review Agent
💬 Insurance Support Bot (Multilingual)
📑 Smart Compliance Document Checker
🧪 QA Test Case Generator (LLM-powered)
🎤 AI Interview Coach (Adaptive)
💡 Startup Idea Validator
📦 Amazon Product Scout (Data-Driven)

Each product solves a real-world problem using LLMs, reasoning models, or document understanding agents. These aren't mockups — they’re live proof that AI can autonomously understand, decide, and act.

I’m open to partnerships, AI consulting, or engineering roles where I can push the boundaries of intelligent agents and real-world AI applications.

Let’s build the future.
